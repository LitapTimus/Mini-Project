# AI Assessment Setup Guide

## Overview
The Career Guidance Assessment includes AI-powered analysis using Google's Gemini API to provide personalized career recommendations based on student responses.

## Features
- **Traditional Analysis**: Rule-based career recommendations based on domain scores
- **AI Analysis**: Advanced AI-powered insights including:
  - Personality type analysis
  - Learning style preferences
  - Work environment recommendations
  - Detailed career paths with salary ranges
  - Development plans and next steps

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variable
1. Open `server/.env` file
2. Add the following line:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key

### 3. Restart the Server
After adding the API key, restart your server to load the new environment variable:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## How It Works

### Assessment Flow
1. Student completes the 72-question multiple intelligence assessment
2. System calculates domain scores (12 intelligence domains)
3. Traditional recommendations are generated
4. AI analysis is attempted:
   - If successful: Enhanced recommendations with AI insights
   - If failed: Falls back to traditional recommendations

### AI Analysis Process
1. Student's answers and domain scores are sent to Gemini API
2. AI generates:
   - Overall strengths analysis
   - Personality and learning style assessment
   - Primary and secondary career recommendations
   - Skills development plan
   - Actionable next steps

## Error Handling

### If AI Analysis Fails
- System automatically falls back to traditional recommendations
- Error is logged for debugging
- Student still receives valuable career guidance
- UI shows "Using Traditional Analysis" indicator

### Common Issues

#### 1. API Key Not Found
**Error**: `GEMINI_API_KEY not found in environment variables`
**Solution**: Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file

#### 2. Invalid API Key
**Error**: `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`
**Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and active

#### 3. Rate Limit Exceeded
**Error**: `429 Too Many Requests`
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes and try again, or upgrade your API plan

#### 4. Network Issues
**Error**: `ECONNREFUSED` or timeout
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings

## Testing the AI Functionality

### 1. Check API Key is Loaded
```bash
# In server directory
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ? 'API Key found' : 'API Key missing')"
```

### 2. Take the Assessment
1. Log in as a student
2. Navigate to "Career Guidance Assessment"
3. Complete all 72 questions
4. Submit the assessment
5. Check the results page for AI analysis section

### 3. Verify AI Analysis
Look for:
- ü§ñ "AI-Powered Career Analysis" section in results
- Green indicator: "AI-Powered Analysis Available"
- Yellow indicator: "Using Traditional Analysis" (if AI failed)

## API Configuration

Current settings in `server/src/services/aiService.js`:
- **Model**: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
- **Max Tokens**: 2000 (comprehensive responses)

## Fallback Mechanism

The system includes a robust fallback mechanism:
1. **Primary**: AI-powered recommendations (if API key is available)
2. **Fallback**: Traditional rule-based recommendations (always available)
3. **Error Display**: Clear indicators to users about analysis type used

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Server Logs
Check server logs for AI-related messages:
```
Starting AI analysis...
Gemini API key found, calling API...
Gemini API response received
AI analysis completed successfully
```

### Error Logs
If AI fails, you'll see:
```
AI analysis failed: [error message]
Gemini AI Analysis Error: [detailed error]
```

### Client-Side Indicators
- ‚úÖ Green: "AI-Powered Analysis Available"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow: "Using Traditional Analysis"

## Cost Considerations

- **Gemini API Free Tier**: 60 requests per minute
- **Cost per Request**: Free tier available, paid plans vary
- **Typical Assessment**: 1 API call per student submission

## Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` file to version control
2. ‚úÖ Use different API keys for development and production
3. ‚úÖ Regularly rotate API keys
4. ‚úÖ Monitor API usage for unusual activity
5. ‚úÖ Set up usage alerts in Google Cloud Console

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify API key is correctly set in `.env`
3. Ensure server has been restarted after adding API key
4. Test API key directly at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
